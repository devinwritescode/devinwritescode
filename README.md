# About Me

Hi, I’m @devinwritescode!

I've been a graphic designer and marketing manager for over 7 years and started breaking into front-end development in 2023.

I’m currently learning Typescript, React, and Node at the moment but want to branch out into learning more tools for full-stack development, especially databases and APIs.

I’m looking to collaborate on fun projects and open-source productivity tools. I like the idea of people being able to use productivity tools that are free and open source, like Joplin, PocketBase, and so on.
